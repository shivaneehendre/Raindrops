Raindrop game:
  This will be a moving circle going across the bottom of the screen. There will be raindrops falling from the top of the screen, and everytime one hits the catcher, it will disappear. There will also be a score on the screen, and everytime a raindrop disappears, the score will increase by one. 

Steps:
- create raindrops(circles)
- create catcher
- get catcher to recognize raindrops, and once it is caught, it goes away
- score will continue to increase until a certain point, or a game over screen may flash at some point.
