Raindrop game:
  This will be a moving circle going across the bottom of the screen. There will be raindrops falling from the top of the screen, and everytime one hits the catcher, it will disappear. There will also be a score on the screen, and everytime a raindrop disappears, the score will increase by one. If three raindrops are missed, the game is over. If the score reaches 30, the player beats the game.

Steps:
- create raindrops(circles)
- create catcher
- get catcher to recognize raindrops, and once it is caught, it goes away
- score will continue to increase until a certain point, or a game over screen may flash at some point. 

Most of my bugs/glitches were resolved during the process of making the game. For example, while trying to create a life system that would end the game after a specified number of raindrops hit the bottom, I had trouble getting these raindrops recognized. Sometimes, the number of lives would not change, other times, it would decrease by two. This problem was resolved with help by changing the way the raindrops were recognized and altering what happened to the raindrops after they had fallen. 

I also had various problems with getting Github to work at home, especially with getting Github to recognize that I had made changes. Sometimes, it would not recognize that I had made changes that needed to be committed.
